# This migration demonstrates importing from a Google Spreadsheet XML feed.
id: test
label: Test with Google Spreadsheet

  plugin: url

  data_parser_plugin: google_sheets
  # The feed file for the spreadsheet. The Google Spreadsheet should be either “Public” or set to “Anyone with link can
  # view” in order for the feed to work. Note that the <SHEET> param is the order of the tabs and WILL change if the
  # tabs are re-ordered.
  # Template: 'https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/<KEY>/<SHEET>/public/values?alt=json'

  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an selector (xpath) for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
  # For Google Spreadsheet XML feeds the actual columns are named with gsx: followed by the cleaned column name (lower,
  # limited punctuation, etc).
  fields:
    -
      name: id
      label: 'Unique identifier'
      selector: 'id'
    -
      name: title
      label: 'Title'
      selector: 'title'
  # Under 'ids', we identify source fields populated above which will uniquely
  # identify each imported item. The 'type' makes sure the migration map table
  # uses the proper schema type for stored the IDs.
  ids:
    id:
      type: integer
# This is the mapping of the source values to the destination.
process:
  type:
    plugin: default_value
    default_value: page
  # Note that the source field names here (id and title) were
  # defined by the 'fields' configuration for the source plugin above.

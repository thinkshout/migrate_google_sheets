  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an selector (xpath) for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
  # For Google Spreadsheet XML feeds the actual columns are named with gsx: followed by the cleaned column name (lower,
  # limited punctuation, etc).
  fields:
    -
      name: path
      label: 'Path'
      selector: 'path'
    -
      name: redirect
      label: 'Redirect'
      selector: 'redirect'
  # Under 'ids', we identify source fields populated above which will uniquely
  # identify each imported item. The 'type' makes sure the migration map table
  # uses the proper schema type for stored the IDs.
  ids:
    redirect:
      type: string
# This is the mapping of the source values to the destination.
